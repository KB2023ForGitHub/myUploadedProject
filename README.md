# Project 1
1. Application 1: General Base Counting
     Queue Implementation
1. Application 2: Postfix Calculator
     Stack Implementation

  This is a project that I completed. It was recently assigned in September. The project includes counting any number in any base from 2 to 8, and printing each number in that base in Application 1. Application 1 required creating and uding a Queue class. Application 2 was about calculating a mathmetical expression by not utilizing the PEMDAS notation but getting the same result if it was used. Application 2 required using and creating a Stack class. For both applications test files were given to test out the different applications.

My project is for learning and making better changes to it. Please use it according to the GNU General Public License v2.0
